This repository aims to make the results from [CGR-CUSUM: A Continuous time Generalized Rapid Response Cumulative Sum chart](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07618) reproducible. 
There are three directories, two of which allow for exact reproducibility of results (`ARL_simulations` and `LROI_appl_sim`).
The directory `Reproducible_example` demonstrates a simple example of the approaches using the publicly available package [success](https://github.com/d-gomon/success) on a simulated data set.

The three subdirectories are described in more detail below.

## ARL_simulations

In this directory the code is contained to perform the simulations in Section 4.1 of [CGR-CUSUM: A Continuous time Generalized Rapid Response Cumulative Sum chart](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07618). Click the directory for more information.


## LROI_appl_sim

In this directory the code is contained to perform the real-life data application in Section 3 and the simulation study in Section 4.2 of [CGR-CUSUM: A Continuous time Generalized Rapid Response Cumulative Sum chart](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07618). Click the directory for more information.


## Reproducible_example

The aim of this directory is to provide users with a simple example of how to perform simulation studies similar to the studies performed in the two above directories using the [success](https://github.com/d-gomon/success) package. The example is facilitated by an enclosed data set containing simulated data.
